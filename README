hs-libgit is a haskell wrapper for git.

It provides lowlevel operations (list/cat object, ..) and some high level operation
(commit, checkout, diff...). it requires the git binary available on the system.

if libgit2 happens someday, the wrapper will be made as a binding on top of the library.

TODO:
- clean the commit/tree parsing
- make it more robust/better error checking
- split modules into multiples files (lowlevel, monad, highlevel)
